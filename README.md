# Project FinjectRoute

The project aims to develop a tool to automate and simplify the process of identifying vulnerable execution paths leading to command injection in binaries.

Through the use of this tool, breakdown and analysis of such sink-source paths should be made easier and faster for reverse engineers, with an emphasis for greater visual representations as well as understandable output and logging for reference.

The component that integrate with Ghidra is written in Java, to be distinguished from "Project Ghost" which is written in Python.
